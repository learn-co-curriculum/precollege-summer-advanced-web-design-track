## Overview

The purpose of this course is to give students an in depth understanding of front-end web development skills including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, advanced jQuery, JSON, and APIs. Students will also have an understanding of design decisions and user experience. By Day 7, they should have the skills needed to create interactive websites and web utilities, either static pages or web utilities. After graduation, a student will be able to continue developing their skills through learn.co, documentation, and other resources. 

## Hints and Hurdles

+ This is a packed course - there is a lot of material to cover. Set the expectation early that it's okay not to complete everything - they have the rest of their lives to master these skills. Every one of them will leave as a programmer, but no one becomes an expert programmer after a few weeks. They have a long time to keep working and learning. 
+ In general, most of day 1 should be review. There is a lot of lecture, but you can move quickly through it. If students are still having trouble with HTML, have them do some independent practice. They still have access to the materials from their last course on [Learn](http://learn.co)
