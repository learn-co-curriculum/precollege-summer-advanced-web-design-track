# JS Frameworks

## Objectives

+ Become aware of powerful Javascript Frameworks

## Motivation

Javascript can be great for simpler websites, but as a site gets more and more complex the code can get harder to manage. Frameworks are still just Javascript libraries, but they often have more data oriented tasks such as creating custom HTML elements in cool ways, moving data from a server to the User Interface, or helping to manage code.

## Lesson Plan

### Mustache.js

[Mustache](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js/) is a template syntax. It makes it really easy to dynamically add HTML elements into the page with Javascript. Imagine you wanted to make a list of the weather from an API call. You could use Mustache to create and insert all of your `<li>'

### Backbone.js

[Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/) allows you to store data in Javascript models and then move that data into your User Interface. It's a fairly lightweight framework with a very small filesize and limited featureset that can be great for more advanced developers.

### Ember.js

[Ember](http://emberjs.com/) is a more opinionated framework for generating custom HTML that is tied to incoming data. It is built off of Handlebars.js and handles navigation within a site well.

### Angular.js

[Angular](https://angularjs.org/) is a very opinionated framework that was developed by Google. It can make moving data to the User very easy and ties closely into existing HTML templates. It is purported to have a very steep learning curve but benefits from high productivity after learning how to use it.

## Conclusion

As your code and websites become more complex you might want to start incorporating more dynamic, constantly changing, data into your sites and have your site react intelligently to those changes. These frameworks all provide powerful ways to do that.
