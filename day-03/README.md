## SWBATs

+ Understand the DOM (Document Object Model)
+ Understand how jQuery is just a *library* of JavaScript functions and that anything jQuery does you can do with plain JavaScript
+ Import and Initialize the jQuery library
+ Understand why you need to wait for the document to be ready
+ Use `$` and `jQuery` to access jQuery functionality
+ Use jQuery and CSS selectors to access HTML elements
+ Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) HTML elements using jQuery
+ Iterate through a jQuery Collection

## Hints and Hurdles

+ Both group labs on this day are difficult, but also a lot of fun. Remind the students that they're awesome and this is supposed to be difficult. 
+ This could also be a good time for mini-culture talks - remind students that it's good for their programs to be broken. If their programs weren't broken, they'd have nothing to do!


## Bare Minimum SWBATs for Tomorrow
+ By tomorrow, students should be starting to feel comfortable with jQuery. Tomorrow is a dive into more advanced jQuery topics.
