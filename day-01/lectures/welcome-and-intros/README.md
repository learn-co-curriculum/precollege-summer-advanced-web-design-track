# Day 1 - Welcome and Intros - Lecture Notes

+ Welcome everyone as they come in! 
+ Play an icebreaker game! Two of our favorites are: 
	* Evolution
	* Group Trivia 
	* An [Improv Game](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/tf-improv-games) could work well here, too. 
+ Now that everyone knows each other, go ahead and start the class.
