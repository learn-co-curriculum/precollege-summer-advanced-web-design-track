# JS Libraries

## Objectives

+ Become aware of cool Javascript libraries
+ Include and use the functionality of those libraries

## Motivation

If you had to reinvent the wheel every time you wanted to drive somewhere, you would never get anywhere. Javascript has a bunch of really cool libraries with amazing functionality. Knowing about them and how to utilize them will enable you to build websites that might otherwise have been impossible.

## Lesson Plan

### Processing.js

[Processing](https://processing.org/) is a visual programming language that makes it really easy to draw to the screen. 

#### p5js

Another great variant of Processing is [p5.js](http://p5js.org/) which has a fantastic [intro video](http://hello.p5js.org/) you should show.

#### Processing.js

It has been ported over to Javascript with [Processing.js](http://processingjs.org/). This means you get all of the visual coding power of Processing in the browser and available to anyone with an internet connection.

Here are some awesome examples of Processing in action:
