# JS Libraries

## Objectives

+ Become aware of cool Javascript libraries

## Motivation

If you had to reinvent the wheel every time you wanted to drive somewhere, you would never get anywhere. Javascript has a bunch of really cool libraries with amazing functionality. Knowing about them and how to utilize them will enable you to build websites that might otherwise have been impossible.

## Lesson Plan

Remember how we talked about jQuery as a Javasript Library? It's just a collection of Javascript code that other developers wrote to make things easier. There are a ton of awesome libraries out there that do everything from making your pages bounce, to showing awesome graphics, to getting the weather. Here are some examples, but as always Google is your friend.

Here are a few different examples - feel free to check out the documentation if you're interested in any of them!

### Processing

[Processing](https://processing.org/) is a visual programming language that makes it really easy to draw to the screen.

Another great variant of Processing is [p5.js](http://p5js.org/) which has a fantastic [intro video](http://hello.p5js.org/) you should show.

#### Processing.js

Processing has also been ported over to Javascript with [Processing.js](http://processingjs.org/). This means you get all of the visual coding power of Processing in the browser and available to anyone with an internet connection.

Here are some awesome examples of Processing in action:
