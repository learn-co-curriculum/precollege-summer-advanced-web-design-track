# User Experience and Wireframing

## Objectives

+ Know what User Experience is and how it affects products
+ Apply UX principles to their design choices
+ Use UX resources to aid them in making their decisions
+ Be able to make coherent stories for users with storyboarding
+ Make wireframes that help define product interfaces

## Motivation

The internet and software are so deeply embedded in our lives that we often don't stop and think about the interfaces that we interact with. Every program and physical item has been designed for use. Some are done very poorly, while some use tools like storyboarding and wireframing to really think about the User Experience and design an amazing product.

## Lesson plan

### User Experience

*Ask the students to discuss some products they really dislike using? What specific features do they dislike?*

*Ask the students to discuss products they love? What specific features do they like?*

Mini-Activity: Have small groups discuss the pro's and con's of specific features of their phone apps. Have them turn to a partner and explain all of the user options at any given interface, the user flow, and identify and critique design decisions.  Have them answer what they think the motivations were of the designer.

+ Questions to think about
	* Why is the Main button of the iPhone at the bottom of the phone? In the center?
	* Why is the camera at the top?  The volume on the sides?  Why are the apps square?  With soft edges?  Why is the screen scroll to the sides? 
+ Every single feature was a deliberate choice to make the best experience for the user
+ When we make choices for our sites, we want to make them as intuitive to use as possible
	* This is to say that a user should be able to use the site the way you intended without any explicit instructions

### Storyboarding

One very valuable tool of a User Experience designer is representing the flow of a user through a site in a graphical manner, this is called Storyboarding. It allows you and other people to very quickly understand how a User would move through your site, and can sometime highlight flaws or undesirable dead ends that may have occurred unaturally.

For these purposes, we’re going to use Gliffy to build a flowchart. 

**How do I Storyboard?**
  + We’re going to use a web application called [Gliffy](http://www.gliffy.com). It’s free!
  + (Teachers log in with hs@flatironschool.com, pw is 33west26).
  + Once your've logged in: 
    + Show example - file called Storyboard demo saved in Gliffy
    + Use Gliffy to put squares and lines and text on page

**Walkthrough: Students should start their project ideation by designing a Storyboard**
  + When you select to draw with Gliffy, students should select a “Flowchart” - it's the first option listed on the left
  + Each group needs to first come up with their opening sentence. It’s the single most important sentence of the story.
  + The text for the two different paths needs to be short. You want to intrigue your reader with a glimpse of where the paths will lead them, without giving it all away until they click 

### Wireframing

If Storyboarding defines what the User *does* the Wireframing defines what they *see*.  A wireframe is a blueprint for a website. It is a skeletal map for what a website will look like and where elements will go on a page. When designing a page with multiple developers, drawing out a wireframe is an incredibly important step in order to get everyone on the same page before you start building. It also lets you set your designs in stone so you don’t do a redesign in the middle of coding out the page. Time saver. 

These are NOT pixel perfect representations, they are rough guides that will show any obvious mistakes and help guide developers as they code.

**Walkthrough**
  + Each group should think about the story they already wrote before they get started. What themes and/or topics emerge? Themes will be important in thinking about design. **Students should take 5 min to discuss and write those down on a white board.**
  + It’s important to think about how you want a user to follow the story and how to walk through your app. How does the story start? What do they click? buttons? a text link? **Students should spend 3 minutes thinking about that**
  + What sort of header and footer do you want on your page? Does it include the title of your story? **Groups spend 5 minutes thinking about header and footer. Draw them out on paper/whiteboard**
  + Where does the text and buttons go in relation to the header and footer? What about images, are you using any? If so, where in relation to what parts of the story? It’s important for user experience that each page is similar. People will expect buttons to go in the same place, etc. **Students spend 6 minutes thinking about images and layout.**
  + Once you have a clear idea of what the page should look like as a group, you should map out wireframes on Gliffy.

## Conclusion

Every design decision, no matter how big or small it may seem, will affect how the user perceives our products. Thinking about users and how they'll use our products will help make our sites better.
