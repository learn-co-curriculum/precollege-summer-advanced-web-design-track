# User Experience and Wireframing

## Objectives

+ Know what User Experience is and how it affects products
+ Apply UX principles to their design choices
+ Use UX resources to aid them in making their decisions
+ Be able to make coherent stories for users with storyboarding
+ Make wireframes that help define product interfaces

## Motivation

The internet and software are so deeply embedded in our lives that we often don't stop and think about the interfaces that we interact with. Every program and physical item has been designed for use. Some are done very poorly, while some use tools like storyboarding and wireframing to really think about the User Experience and design an amazing product.

## Lesson plan

### User Experience

*Ask the students to discuss some products they really dislike using? What specific features do they dislike?*

*Ask the students to discuss products they love? What specific features do they like?*

Mini-Activity: Have small groups discuss the pro's and con's of specific features of their phone apps. Have them turn to a partner and explain all of the user options at any given interface, the user flow, and identify and critique design decisions.  Have them answer what they think the motivations were of the designer.

+ Questions to think about
	* Why is the Main button of the iPhone at the bottom of the phone? In the center?
	* Why is the camera at the top?  The volume on the sides?  Why are the apps square?  With soft edges?  Why is the screen scroll to the sides? 
+ Every single feature was a deliberate choice to make the best experience for the user
+ When we make choices for our sites, we want to make them as intuitive to use as possible
	* This is to say that a user should be able to use the site the way you intended without any explicit instructions

### Storyboarding

One very valuable tool of a User Experience designer is representing the flow of a user through a site in a graphical manner, this is called Storyboarding. It allows you and other people to very quickly understand how a User would move through your site, and can sometime highlight flaws or undesirable dead ends that may have occurred unaturally.
