## SWBAT

### Hashes

+ Understand how a the Hash data structure works conceptually
+ Create Hashes
+ Add, remove, and edit elements
+ Iterate through a hash
+ Nest hashes within one another

### JSON

+ Understand how JSON is used on the web
+ Relate JSON to hashes
+ Navigate through JSON structures

### API's

+ Connect to any public facing API
+ Store and access the returned JSON of an API
+ Use callbacks to interpret and act on the returned data 
+ Surface that data to the UI

## Hints and Hurdles
+ This is another difficult day - remind the students that they're awesome!
+ Be sure you and all the students install the [JSON Viewer Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jsonview/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc?hl=en) - it will let you view JSON in a really nice way. 
+ The `$getJSON` method is very complex - there's a lot going on. Go slow, break it down into steps. Remind the students it's okay to feel uncomfortable. 

### Bare Minimum SWBATs 
+ We can store data in hashes - they're basically like arrays, but use named keys instead of numbers
+ We can push hashes and arrays inside of other hashes
+ We access data like this `teams["Brooklyn Nets"]["players"]`
+ We can connect to other apps using APIs - they send us the data as a JSON object, which we can treat like a big nested hash.
