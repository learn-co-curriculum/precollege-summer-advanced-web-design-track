## Intro to APIs

## SWBATs

+ Connect to any public facing API
+ Store and access the returned JSON of an API
+ Use callbacks to interpret and act on the returned data
+ Surface that data to the UI

## Motivation

There are TONS of cool ways to connect other applications to extend our app's functionality. Want to include GIFs based on user searches? Show Tweets related to your site? We can do this and much, much more using APIs!

## Lesson Notes

## What is an API?
![Web APIs](http://www.apiacademy.co/sites/default/files/Web-APIs-v5_0.png)
+ API stands for "Application Programming Interface". 
+ In a nutshell, an API is a set of instructions that allows developers to change and control existing web applications. It's a way for the developers of existing applications to allow other people to get their data in a controlled way. 
+ For example, the facebook API has a specific function that allows developers to integrate posting to a facebook wall. The Twitter API has a function that allows developers to display all of a user's tweets.

+ Many of the biggest web applications have APIs: Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Google Maps, and many more. These APIs allow developers to connect to these applications to use the apps' data in their own development work. Here are just a few ways APIs work in the real world:

+ Signing in to a new website using your Facebook account (OAuth)
+ Using Google Maps inside of the Uber applicaiton
+ Being able to send a tweet when you are playing a video game and want to show your progress to friends.

See if you can identify the use of APIs next time you use the internet.
